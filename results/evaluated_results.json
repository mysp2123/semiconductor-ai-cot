It seems likely that if the model is to adapt to the parameters of the problem, such as gravity, it would need to be adapted much more finely as the training of the model has to conform to its conditions and training of data, which in turn is expected during the trial of the solution. If the model does not fit it would still need to be adapted to new conditions.\n\nThe models for any given problem are quite different though. There are lots of models, each with one basic element, such as one for small problems or a whole problem. In these models the problem is to find an easy solution so that a certain point of distance at which the model is to be adapted would suffice. If there are some other points of motion the model probably cannot adapt to, such as if there is a force"

The concept of pair similarity suggests that we are able to distinguish these groups based on a combination of cognitive abilities.
